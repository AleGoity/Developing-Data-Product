# Instructions

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

# Creating a map

I create a map that shows the city where I live, Santiago de Chile.
```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(lat=-33.4513, lng=-70.6653, popup = "Santiago, Chile")

my_map
```
